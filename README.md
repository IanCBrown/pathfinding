# pathfinding
This is a fairly basic python application I am working on to better learn the language in my free time. 

The idea is to create a grid that I can run various pathfinding algorithms on (DFS, BFS, etc.) and see the path it took to get to the finish.

As of now, a basic linear traversal is all that has been implemented as to test the drawing capabilities in the window. I might swap to another framework such as Processing + Python. 

Below is a screenshot of the linear traversal. The path taken is in green.

The project uses the numpy and pygame libraries. 
* numpy is used for quick 2d array creation 
* pygame is used to draw and update the output window
